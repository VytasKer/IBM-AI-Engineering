## Introduction
This repository showcases my journey through IBM's AI Engineering course, where I gained hands-on experience in various AI technologies and methodologies. Each Jupyter Notebook contains code snippets, explanations, and results for different projects that I've completed.

## Technologies Used

### Keras, TensorFlow, and PyTorch
- **Keras**: Implemented neural networks and built deep learning models using Keras, focusing on tasks like classification and regression.
- **TensorFlow**: Leveraged TensorFlow for model training, evaluation, and optimization, with a particular emphasis on creating custom layers and loss functions.
- **PyTorch**: Explored PyTorch for building dynamic computational graphs and performing advanced model training.

### RAG and LangChain
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**: Applied RAG techniques to enhance the performance of generative models by incorporating external knowledge bases.
- **LangChain**: Utilized LangChain to build complex NLP workflows seamlessly, integrating various language models for enhanced natural language processing capabilities.

### LLMs and NLP
- **LLMs (Large Language Models)**: Gained practical experience in working with LLMs, understanding their architectures, and utilizing them for tasks like text generation and summarization.
- **NLP (Natural Language Processing)**: Implemented various NLP techniques, including tokenization, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition, using both traditional and deep learning methods.

### Image Processing
- Explored image processing techniques using popular libraries like OpenCV and PIL, focusing on tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image augmentation.

## Additional Topics
In addition to the core subjects, this course also covered:
- Model evaluation and selection techniques.
- Hyperparameter tuning and model optimization strategies.
- Deployment of machine learning models using tools like Flask and Docker.
